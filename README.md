# 🚀 Migel — A Vibe-Coded Programming Language ✨

Migel is a programming language designed to be **simple**, **clear**, and **JS-compatible** — and we *really* mean that last part! 😎

> 💡 **VIBE CODED !!!**  
> This first version of Migel was written entirely by AI! I'm planning to rewrite the whole project myself soon — just wanted to keep it 100% transparent. 🔮

## 🤔 What is Migel?

Migel is a tiny language that feels like home if you love JavaScript! Here's the magic:

- ✨ The standard library **"charcoal"** is written in JS  
- ⚙️ Migel runs on **Node.js**  
- 💫 Your Migel code gets **transpiled** straight into JavaScript  
- 🧪 That means you get all the JS superpowers — *for free*!

---

## ⚡ How Does It Work?

No compiler. No interpreter. Just pure ✨ *transpilation magic* ✨

Your Migel code gets translated into JavaScript, which then runs like any other JS code. Simple, right?

> We might build a real compiler someday… but for now, transpilation keeps things light

## 🌈 Features

✅ **Dynamic typing** — just like JS
✅ **JS-style syntax** — feels familiar instantly  
✅ **Super simple names** — `write()` writes to the console, duh! ✍️  
✅ **Built-in stdlib ("charcoal")** — handy tools out of the box    
✅ **JS/npm access** — import *almost* any JS file or npm package 📦 (check the docs)
🚫 No obj.prop relations — keep it flat, keep it clean! (No dot-chaining objects here.)

## 🔮 What's Next?

- ✍️ **Rewrite the core** — by hand, with love
- 📚 **Expand the stdlib** — more helpers, more fun  
- 🚀 **Level up built-ins** — because why stop at `write()`?
